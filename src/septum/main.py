    Note:
        If only the origin station is provided, the schedule will show departure times only.
        If both origin and destination are provided, the schedule will include both departure
        and arrival times.

        IMPORTANT: Be very careful about the `direction` parameter.
        For example, if you are going from Trenton to Gray 30th Street on the TRE line, your direction should be 0.
        This is because Gray 30th Street, is towards the city (i.e inbound). Your direction cannot be 1,
        because you cannot go to Gray 30th Street while going away from the city (i.e outbound). The API the best it
        can to validate this and return an error message, but there might be edge cases that still slip away, please
        open an issue on https://github.com/dotzenith/septum

        Also note that schedule items returned when `dest` is not passed in might have inconsistencies.
        Some of the items might be for trains that don't go anywhere after this station. Therefore passing in `dest`
        is recommended.
